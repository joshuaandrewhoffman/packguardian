# Pack Guardian
Packguaridan is a playtesting tool for card game designers.

It enables users to "draft" cards in a variety of different ways as a means of evaluating game balance. Drafts can be played live, asynchronously, or a mix of the two.

## Work In Progress
Packguardian is still under development as I have spare hours on nights/weekends. As such, there's a lot that's rough around the edges. Take a look at the issues I've filed against the project for an idea of where we're headed :)

## Thank You
This project is based on David Zukowski's [react-redux-starter-kit](https://github.com/davezuko/react-redux-starter-kit)
I forked his work in July of 2016 to help teach myself React/Redux, ES6, Node, Mongo, etc.

Without such a strong starter kit, I definitely wouldn't have been able to make something useful in a brand new stack.
Thanks David!
